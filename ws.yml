    ## API stability

    We stage our APIs from numbers ranging from 0 to 6.

    #### 0 - Unavailable

    This feature was introduced very recently, and it is
    not implemented in current versions, but may be available in future.

    #### 1 - Experimental

    This feature was introduced recently, and may change
    or be removed in future versions. Please try it out and provide feedback.
    If it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the core team.

    #### 2 - Unstable

    The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had
    sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility
    will be maintained if reasonable.

    #### 3 - Stable

    The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying
    code may cause minor changes. Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.

    #### 4 - Frozen

    This API has been tested extensively in production and is
    unlikely to ever have to change.

    #### 5 - Locked

    Unless serious bugs are found, this code will not ever
    change. Please do not suggest changes in this area, they will be refused.

    #### 6 - Deprecated

    This feature is known to be problematic, and changes are
    planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards
    compatibility should not be expected.
