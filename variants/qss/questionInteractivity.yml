  Determines the type of the question interactivity.

  ## Options

  * `single_selected`: Questions that have multiple options,
  but a only one answer is true. This type of the questions are mostly
  seen in wide-spread exams, such as [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT).
  Also known as 'test' questions.

  * `multiple_inclusive`: Questions that have multiple options,
  but everything could be selected. If any correct option is selected by
  the user, the question will be counted as correct. *Consider using
  `single_selected` option while preparing question groups
  instead of this option, since it limits the number of possible answers a
  user can provide.*

  * `multiple_exclusive`: Similar to `multiple_inclusive`, everything could
  be selected. However, there is only one correct combination of options set,
  otherwise, will be counted as failed. *Consider using `single_selected`
  option while preparing question groups instead of this option, since it
  limits the number of possible answers a user can provide.*

  * `freeform`: Questions that provide freeform text input, possibly with
  constraints. Mostly seen in college prep-exams.

  * `fill_in_the_blanks`: Questions that provide partial body, with a
  collidable answer input.
