              Body of the question.

              ## Interpretation

              The body is evaluated in client-side devices with their given
              MIME type.

              #### Plain text
              Clients can render plain text question bodies, without any
              additional styling.

              This is determined by the `text/plain` MIME type.

              #### Markdown

              Clients can use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
              flavor of Markdown to render question bodies.

              This is determined by the `text/markdown` MIME type.

              #### HTML

              Clients can use restricted set of
              [HTML](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866) with
              [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) capabilities.

              This is determined by the `text/html` MIME type.

              ## Examples

              #### An HTML-based question

              ```html
              Which one of the following is a <strong>mammal</strong>?
              ```

              #### A Markdown-based question

              ```markdown
              Which one of the following is a **mammal**?
              ```
            example: Which one of the following is a **mammal**?
