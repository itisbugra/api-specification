              National Curriculum assessment usually refers to the statutory
              assessments carried out in primary schools in England,
              colloquially known as standard attainment tests (SATs).
              The assessments are made up of a combination of testing and
              teacher assessment judgements, and are used in all
              government-funded primary schools in England to assess the
              attainment of pupils against the programmes of study of the
              National Curriculum at the end of Key Stages 1 and 2, when most
              pupils are aged 7 and 11 respectively. Until 2008, assessments
              were also required at the end of Key Stage 3 (14-year-olds)
              in secondary schools.
